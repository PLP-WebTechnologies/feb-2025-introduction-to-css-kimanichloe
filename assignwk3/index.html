    <div>
        <p>This is the first section of our content. We've added some padding and a border to this div to make it stand out. The background is also white for better readability against the light gray body.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="section-title">Another Section</h3>
        <p>This is another content block. Notice how the section title uses a different font and color, thanks to the class selector in our CSS.</p>
        <p>We've also applied margins to the div elements to create spacing between them.</p>
